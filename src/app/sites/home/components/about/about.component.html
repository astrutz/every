          Certainly! Let’s craft an engaging and updated “About Me” section for your portfolio website. Here’s the revised version:

About Me
Hello! I’m a passionate software engineer with a focus on full-stack web development. My mission? To breathe life into digital products by combining technical expertise with a user-centric approach. Whether it’s creating seamless user experiences, implementing responsive designs, or writing clean, high-performance code, I thrive on turning ideas into reality.

Journey and Growth
My journey began in 2017 when I dipped my toes into web development while studying. Since then, I’ve embraced new challenges, continuously evolved, and stayed at the forefront of technology. Over the past six years, I’ve honed my skills and now build cutting-edge web applications using a stack that includes Angular, TypeScript, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and Ruby on Rails.

End-to-End Enthusiast
As a proactive team member, I relish working on projects from ideation to production release. There’s something magical about seeing a concept evolve into a polished product. Whether it’s brainstorming features, architecting solutions, or squashing bugs, count me in!

Beyond the Code
When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me:

Running Across Football Pitches: I’m a sports enthusiast, and nothing beats the thrill of a good match.
Throwing Darts: Precision and focus—both essential in coding and darts!
Drumming: Rhythms keep me grounded, just like well-structured code.
Enjoying Free Time: Because balance matters.
Let’s Connect!
Feel free to reach out—I’m available for open-source collaborations, discussions, or just to say hello! 😊 You can find me on GitHub, where I actively support open-source projects.

Remember to personalize this section with your own experiences, achievements, and unique voice. Happy coding! 🚀

          I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've continued to grow and
          evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along
          the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I'm
          building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js,
          TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
        </p>
        <p class="text-normal text-base">
          I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from
          ideation all the way to development.
